    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I'm Anna Oleksyeyenko, hard working and driven full stack developer with addiction to create the most elegant and functional solutions in modern web design.

      I am currently a student at Sacramento City College and working towards a A.S. in Computer Science. Last year I obtained my Certificate of Achievement in Web Development.
      I believe my courses in programming and web development
      have equipped me for joing an experienced team where I will take my place.
      In addition to completed courses, I have gained experience in
      the business environment at DMS Market Research and Customer Experience (Kiev, Ukraine).
      I displayed skills such as developing and maintaining the client-business
      environment, utilizing PowerPoint to create persentations and completing all projects in time.
      I gained the ability to take directions from clients to meet their needs in regards to their
      expectations about the final projects. Different clients required different directions, as 
      a result, I developed flexible and adaptable skills too.

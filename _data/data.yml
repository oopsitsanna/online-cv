career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I'm Will Rowe, a computational biologist working in microbial genomics.

      I write software to analyse metagenomic data.
      My main areas of interest are in identifying genetic
      variation within microbiomes using variation graphs,
      as well classifying microbiome samples using
      data sketching methods and machine learning.
